# Physics Formula Calculator
 Python GUI that takes variables and derives all possible data from them by using formulas and re-entering results

 Issue: app rounds results to 2 D.P, the rounded result is then passed back into the algorithm which leads to some inconsistent/multiple answers for some variables :(
